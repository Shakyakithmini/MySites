      <h1>Cultivation</h1>

      <p>In general, quality vanilla only comes from good vines and through careful production methods. Commercial
        vanilla production can be performed under open field and "greenhouse" operations. The two production systems
        share these similarities:

        Plant height and number of years before producing the first grains
        Shade necessities
        Amount of organic matter needed
        A tree or frame to grow around (bamboo, coconut or Erythrina lanceolata)
        Labor intensity (pollination and harvest activities)[40]
        Vanilla grows best in a hot, humid climate from sea level to an elevation of 1,500 m.[41] The ideal climate has
        moderate rainfall, 1,500–3,000 mm, evenly distributed through 10 months of the year. Optimum temperatures for
        cultivation are 15–30 °C (59–86 °F) during the day and 15–20 °C (59–68 °F) during the night. Ideal humidity is
        around 80%, and under normal greenhouse conditions, it can be achieved by an evaporative cooler. However, since
        greenhouse vanilla is grown near the equator and under polymer (HDPE) netting (shading of 50%), this humidity
        can be achieved by the environment. Most successful vanilla growing and processing is done in the region within
        10 to 20° of the equator.[41]</p>

  <h1>Propagation, preparation and type of stock</h1>
  <p>
    Dissemination of vanilla can be achieved either by stem cutting or by tissue culture. For stem cutting, a progeny
    garden needs to be established. All plants need to grow under 50% shade, as well as the rest of the crop. Mulching
    the trenches with coconut husk and micro irrigation provide an ideal microclimate for vegetative growth.[44]
    Cuttings between 60 and 120 cm (24 and 47 in) should be selected for planting in the field or greenhouse. Cuttings
    below 60 to 120 cm (24 to 47 in) need to be rooted and raised in a separate nursery before planting. Planting
    material should always come from unflowered portions of the vine. Wilting of the cuttings before planting provides
    better conditions for root initiation and establishment.<br>
    Before planting the cuttings, trees to support the vine must be planted at least three months before sowing the
    cuttings. Pits of 30 × 30 × 30 cm are dug 30 cm (12 in) away from the tree and filled with farm yard manure
    (vermicompost), sand and top soil mixed well. An average of 2000 cuttings can be planted per hectare (2.5 acres).
    One important consideration is that when planting the cuttings from the base, four leaves should be pruned and the
    pruned basal point must be pressed into the soil in a way such that the nodes are in close contact with the soil,
    and are placed at a depth of 15 to 20 cm (5.9 to 7.9 in).[43] The top portion of the cutting is tied to the tree
    using natural fibers such as banana or hemp.</p>
