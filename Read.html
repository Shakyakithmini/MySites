    <h1><u>History</u></h1>
    <p>
    <h2>Vanilla is an economically important crop as it is the source of natural vanillin. It is believed that vanilla
        is indigenous to northeastern Mexico. It is ancient Totonaco Indians of Mexico who were the first keepers of the
        secrets of vanilla. When they were defeated by the Aztecs they were demanded to relinquish their exotic fruit, vanilla pods. Later Aztecs were defeated by
        the Spanish and Spaniard Hernando Cortez, the Spanish mariner, returned to Spain with the precious
        plunder vanilla beans which were combined with cacao to make an unusual and pleasing drink.
        For eighty years this special beverage was only enjoyed by the nobility and the very rich.
        Then in 1602 Hugh Morgan, Apothecary to Queen Elizabeth I, suggested that vanilla could be used as a
        flavoring all by itself and versatility of the exotic bean was finally uncovered. However, only in 1858,
        Gobley was able to isolate vanillin from vanilla pods.Today vanilla is grown by Madagascar, Indonesia, Mexico,
        Tahiti and few other countries including Sri Lanka as a commercial crop.
